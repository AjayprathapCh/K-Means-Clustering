The data set contains details of football players. The player Song is injured and coach wants to have appropriate replacement of Song. We need to find appropriate segment from which the coach can replace the injured player.

The aim is to group similar type of players together using K-means clustering algorithm, find out to which gorup the player 'song' belongs to and find out the best possible replacement to him.
